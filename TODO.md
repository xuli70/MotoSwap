# TODO.md - MotoSwap Project Status

## Project Overview
MotoSwap is a motorcycle-focused house exchange platform built as a single-page application with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Current Status
- **Core Application**: Fully functional SPA with all main sections implemented
- **Features Completed**: 
  - User registration/authentication system (mock)
  - Property listings with motorcycle compatibility matching
  - Filtering system by bike type, location, and facilities
  - Messaging/chat interface with simulated responses
  - Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Implement actual backend integration (currently using mock data)
- [ ] Add real authentication system
- [ ] Implement persistent data storage
- [ ] Add image upload functionality for properties
- [ ] Enhance search/filter capabilities
- [ ] Add property availability calendar
- [ ] Implement notification system
- [ ] Add user reviews/ratings system
- [ ] Create admin panel for property moderation
- [ ] Add multi-language support

## Known Issues
- Chat messages are simulated with setTimeout (needs real-time implementation)
- All data is stored in-memory (lost on page refresh)
- Images are placeholders only

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile device testing (iOS, Android)
- [ ] Accessibility audit
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security review for when backend is implemented

## Next Session Priority
1. Assess specific feature requirements from user
2. Determine if backend implementation is needed
3. Review and fix any reported bugs
4. Enhance existing features based on user feedback
